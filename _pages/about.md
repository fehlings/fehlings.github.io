Hello! I am Luca Fehlings, a PhD student in the Bio-Inspired Circuits and Systems group at the university of Groningen.
Currently, I research ferroelectric HfO2-based devices and their integration into conventional memory macros as well as neuromorphic CMOS circuits. Together with my colleagues I am realizing circuit building blocks that allow efficient memory storage as well as learning on biological time-scales in hardware.

My research interests cover the topics of process integration, compact modeling and electrical characterization of semiconductor and memory devices, particularly regarding their integrability and reliability.

I hold a B.Sc and M.Sc degree from RWTH Aachen in Electrical Engineering, which I received in 2019 and 2022. During that time I worked on photonics, 2D-materials and organic semiconductors.
